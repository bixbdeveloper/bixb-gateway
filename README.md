Bixbpay plug-in is a payment method for shopping products and services online using Bixbcoin payments; it enables users to simply employ the API on their website without prior coding knowledge. Also, it doesn't require authentication as it is a decentralized payment process. It provides a fast and secure way to accept digital payments and receive fiat currency immediately in exchange. It's free for both online shop providers, while they only need to pay the minimum transaction fee of the Bixbcoin blockchain.

Copy the API code from BIXBPay and paste it into the Plug-In!
